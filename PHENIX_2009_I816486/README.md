I'm unsure who initially wrote this one because it looks like the name was fixed.  Contributions from Christal Martin, Sean Grace, Joesph Beller Josie Hakanson.

This one needs some clean up and I believe that there are still some histograms which need to be implemented.
All of the sums of weights should be turned off.
Any RAA's should be on a linear scale.

This one needs to have beams implemented with both options, either picked up by the MC generator or set manually on the command line.

Please add protection so that we do not divide by zero in finalyze.
