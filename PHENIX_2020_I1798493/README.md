Gamma-hadron correlations

This analysis will be difficult for an undergraduate to debug, but it's probably (mostly) right.

Implemented by Ryan Goodman.  Contributions from Antonio Da Silva.  Minor contributions from Adam Tilley, Sean Grace, Nik Nelson, Joesph Beller.

This is an awesome analysis.  It's giving a core dump when making plots.  That's bad!  It does it even when the .plot file is empty so it's something funky and would take some debugging.  For now we will table it.
