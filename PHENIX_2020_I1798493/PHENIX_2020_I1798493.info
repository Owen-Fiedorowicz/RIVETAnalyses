Description: We present direct photon-hadron correlations in 200 GeV/A Au+Au, d+Au, and p+p collisions, for direct photon pT from 5â€“12 GeV/c, collected by the PHENIX Collaboration in the years from 2006 to 2011. 
We observe no significant modification of jet fragmentation in d+Au collisions, indicating that cold nuclear matter effects are small or absent. 
Hadrons carrying a large fraction of the quark's momentum are suppressed in Au+Au compared to p+p and d+Au. 
As the momentum fraction decreases, the yield of hadrons in Au+Au increases to an excess over the yield in p+p collisions. 
The excess is at large angles and at low hadron pT and is most pronounced for hadrons associated with lower momentum direct photons. 
Comparison to theoretical calculations suggests that the hadron excess arises from medium response to energy deposited by jets.
