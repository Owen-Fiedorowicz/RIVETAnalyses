Rcp in Au+Au 130 GeV
Needs Au+Au and p+p 130 GeV to build up statistics.

Originally written by Taylor Sussmane, with contributions from Sean Grace and Nik Nelson.

This analysis is in good shape except that some of the plots have poor names and it needs the bin shift correction applied.

The titles for the RAA and RCP plots need to be improved because they aren't accurate.  Better to make them conform to the styles of the other plots.

Needs flags set so it can either work with beams from the generator or set by hand.

Update: fixed .plot file for RAA and RCP plots. Added binshift function still needs implemented.
