I'm unsure who initially wrote this analysis because its name was changed.  Contributions from Christal Martin, Sean Grace, Joesph Beller.

This is a dihadron correlation analysis.

This one has a double booked histogram, which is preventing it from running.  This will take involved debugging.  That said, I think that it is likely almost done.

No one should work on this until we have debugged the issue mentioned above.
