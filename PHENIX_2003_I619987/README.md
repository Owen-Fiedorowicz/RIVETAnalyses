Done by Joesph Beller and Olivia Bartoshky

This one appears to be done but I get a lot of errors when making plots

Update: The errors occur from NaN values in the .dat files that are created when runing rivet-mkhtml. Updated .cc file to add exceptions to these errors in non histogram division. Needs checked by someone with more experience.
