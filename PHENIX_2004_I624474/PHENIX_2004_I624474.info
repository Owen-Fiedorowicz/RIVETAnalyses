Description: The centrality dependence of transverse momentum distributions and yields for $\pi^{\pm{}}$, $K^{\pm{}}$, p and $\bar{p}$ in Au+Au collisions at $\sqrt{s_{NN}}$ = 200 GeV at mid-rapidity are measured by the PHENIX experiment at RHIC. We observe a clear particle mass dependence of the shapes of transverse momentum spectra in central collisions below ~ 2 GeV/c in $p_T$. Both mean transverse momenta and particle yields per participant pair increase from peripheral to mid-central and saturate at the most central collisions for all particle species. We also measure particle ratios of $\pi^{-}/\pi^{+}$, K^-/K^+, p^bar/p, K/pi, p/pi and p^bar/pi as a function of p_T and collision centrality. The ratios of equal mass particle yields are independent of p_T and centrality within the experimental uncertainties. In central collisions at intermediate transverse momenta ~ 1.5-4.5 GeV/c, proton and anti-proton yields constitute a significant fraction of the charged hadron production and show a scaling behavior different from that of pions.
