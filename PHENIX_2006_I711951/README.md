Identified particle spectra in d+Au

Primarily written by Adam Tilley.  Contributions by Christian Reckziegel, Antonio Da Silva, Sean Grace, Nik Nelson.

- Plots labeled and are linear. 
Uses final state particles, which is not correct because this doesn't include some of the subtleties of identifying particles.  Should use ALICE projection.
Identifies particles through flags.  Should be set up so it can either use generator or flags.
- Bin shift correction added.
