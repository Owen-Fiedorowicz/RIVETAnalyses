- updated to use ALICE projection. 
- Identifies particles through generator or flags.
- Bin shift correction added. 

To Do:
Double check if it should be 1/2pi pT in the denominator
Double check that the data look like they are in agreement with the HEPData entry - the plots in Rivet appear to have unusually large uncertainties
