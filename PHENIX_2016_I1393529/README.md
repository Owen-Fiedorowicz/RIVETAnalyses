Heavy flavor electron analysis

This analysis may have some subtle details with electron selection which need care.  This looks right but I might prefer to double check on the Rivet Mattermost to make sure we did this right.

Bottom fractions and RAA should be plotted on a linear scale.
Some of the histograms which do not have data should be turned off, perhaps all of them.

Needs bin shift correction
