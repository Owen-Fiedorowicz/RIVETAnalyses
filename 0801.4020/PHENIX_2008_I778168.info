Description:
  'For Au + Au collisions at 200 GeV we measure neutral pion production with good statistics for transverse momentum, $p_T$, up to 20 GeV/c. A fivefold suppression is found, which is essentially constant for $5 < p_T < 20$ GeV/c. Experimental uncertainties are small enough to constrain any model-dependent parameterization for the transport coefficient of the medium, e.g. $\langle \hat{q} \rangle$ in the parton quenching model. The spectral shape is similar for all collision classes, and the suppression does not saturate in Au+Au collisions; instead, it increases proportional to the number of participating nucleons, as $N^{2/3}_{part}$.'
