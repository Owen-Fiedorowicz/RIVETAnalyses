  BNL-RHIC. We report the measurement of direct photons at midrapidity in Au+Au collisions at $\sqrt{s_{NN}}$=200GeV. The direct photon signal was extracted for the transverse momentum range of 4 GeV/c <$p_T$<22 GeV/c, using a statistical method to subtract decay photons from the inclusive photon sample.The direct-photon nuclear-modification factor $R_{AA}$ was calculated as a function of $p_T$ for different $Au+Au$ collision centralities using the measured $p+p$ direct-photon spectrum and compared totheoretical predictions.$R_{AA}$ was found to be consistent with unity for all centralities over theentire measuredpTrange. Theoretical models that account for modifications ofinitial-direct-photonproduction due to modified-parton-distribution functions(PDFs) in Au and the different isospin composition of the nuclei predict a modest change of $R_{AA}$ from unity. They are consistent with the data.  Models with compensating effects of the quark-gluon plasma on high-energy photons,such as suppression of jet-fragmentation photons and induced-photon bremsstrahlung from partonstraversing the medium, are also consistent with this measurement.
