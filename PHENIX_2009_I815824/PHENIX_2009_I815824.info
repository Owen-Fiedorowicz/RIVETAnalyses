Description: We report the observation at the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC) of suppression of back-to-back correlations in the direct photon+jet channel in Au+Au relative to p+p collisions. 
Two-particle correlations of direct photon triggers with associated hadrons are obtained by statistical subtraction of the decay photon-hadron background. 
The initial momentum of the away-side parton is tightly constrained, because the parton-photon pair exactly balance in momentum at leading order in perturbative quantum chromodynamics (pQCD), making such correlations a powerful probe of the in-medium parton energy loss. 
The away-side nuclear suppression factor, I_AA, in central Au+Au collisions, is 0.32 +/- 0.12(stat) +/- 0.09(syst) for hadrons of 3 < p_T < 5 in coincidence with photons of 5 < p_T < 15 GeV/c. 
The suppression is comparable to that observed for high-p_T single hadrons and dihadrons. 
The direct photon associated yields in p+p collisions scale approximately with the momentum balance, z_T = p_T^hadron/p_T^photon, as expected for a measure of the away-side parton fragmentation function. 
We compare to Au+Au collisions for which the momentum balance dependence of the nuclear modification should be sensitive to the path-length dependence of parton energy loss.
