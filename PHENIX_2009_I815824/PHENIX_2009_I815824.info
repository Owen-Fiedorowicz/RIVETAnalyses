Description: We report the observation at the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC) of suppression of back-to-back correlations in the direct photon+jet channel in Au+Au relative to $p$+$p$ collisions. Two-particle correlations of direct photon triggers with associated hadrons are obtained by statistical subtraction of the decay photon-hadron background. The initial momentum of the away-side parton is tightly constrained, because the parton-photon pair exactly balance in momentum at leading order in perturbative quantum chromodynamics (pQCD), making such correlations a powerful probe of the in-medium parton energy loss. The away-side nuclear suppression factor, $I_{AA}$, in central Au+Au collisions, is 0.32 $\pm$ 0.12(stat) $\pm$ 0.09(syst) for hadrons of 3 < $p_T$ < 5 in coincidence with photons of 5 < $p_T$ < 15 GeV/$c$. The suppression is comparable to that observed for high-$p_T$ single hadrons and dihadrons. The direct photon associated yields in $p$+$p$ collisions scale approximately with the momentum balance, $z_T$ = $p_T^{hadron/{p_T^{photon}}}$, as expected for a measure of the away-side parton fragmentation function. We compare to Au+Au collisions for which the momentum balance dependence of the nuclear modification should be sensitive to the path-length dependence of parton energy loss.
