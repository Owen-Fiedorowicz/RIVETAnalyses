I am unsure who created this initially.  It may have had a name change.

This is a gamma-hadron correlation analysis.  There are no plot labels.
Yield plots should be put on a linear (not log) scale.
Counters should be turned off.
Needs to have beam determination changed so that it allows beams to be set manually.


This one probably does the right thing so we should run it for higher statistics but it's going to be kind of hard for an undergraduate to debug.  I think that it has not been tested for high statistics.

This note should stay because it should be discussed:
We went with the charged final state because I believe no feeddown corrections were done for any correlation analyses.  That said, this should be discussed at approval.
