Description: Measurements of midrapidity charged-particle multiplicity distributions, ${dN_{ch}}/{d\eta}$, and midrapidity transverse-energy distributions, ${dE_T}/{d\eta}$, are presented for a variety of collision systems and energies. Included are distributions for Au+Au collisions at $\sqrt{s_{NN}}$ = 200, 130, 62.4, 39, 27, 19.6, 14.5, and 7.7 GeV, Cu+Cu collisions at $\sqrt{s_{NN}}$ = 200 and 62.4 GeV, Cu+Au collisions at $\sqrt{s_{NN}}$ = 200 GeV, U+U collisions at $\sqrt{s_{NN}}$ = 193 GeV, $d$+Au collisions at $\sqrt{s_{NN}}$ = 200 GeV, He$^3$+Au collisions at $\sqrt{s_{NN}}$ = 200 GeV, and $p$+$p$ collisions at $\sqrt{s_{NN}}$ = 200 GeV. Centrality-dependent distributions at midrapidity are presented in terms of the number of nucleon participants, $N_{part}$, and the number of constituent quark participants, $N_{qp}$. For all A+A collisions down to $\sqrt{s_{NN}}$ = 7.7 GeV, it is observed that the midrapidity data are better described by scaling with $N_{qp}$ than scaling with $N_{part}$. Also presented are estimates of the Bjorken energy density, $\epsilon_{BJ}$, and the ratio of ${dE_T}/{d\eta}$ to ${dN_{ch}}/{d\eta}$, the latter of which is seen to be constant as a function of centrality for all systems.
