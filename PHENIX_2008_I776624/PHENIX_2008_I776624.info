Description:
  'Yields for J/psi production in Cu+Cu collisions at $\sqrt{s_{NN}}$=200GeV have been measured by the PHENIX experiment over the rapidity range $|y| < 2.2$ at transverse momenta from 0 to beyond 5 GeV/c. The invariant yield is obtained as a function of rapidity, transverse momentum and collision centrality, and compared with results in p+p and Au+Au collisions at the same energy. The Cu+Cu data provide greatly improved precision over existing Au+Au data for J/psi production in collisions with small to intermediate numbers of participants, providing a key constraint that is needed for disentangling cold and hot nuclear matter effects.'
ValidationInfo:
