Description: Yields for $J/\psi$ production in Cu+Cu collisions at $\sqrt{s_{NN}}$= 200 GeV have been measured by the PHENIX experiment over the rapidity range $|y|$ < 2.2 at transverse momenta from 0 to beyond 5 GeV/$c$. The invariant yield is obtained as a function of rapidity, transverse momentum and collision centrality, and compared with results in $p$+$p$ and Au+Au collisions at the same energy. The Cu+Cu data provide greatly improved precision over existing Au+Au data for $J/\psi$ production in collisions with small to intermediate numbers of participants, providing a key constraint that is needed for disentangling cold and hot nuclear matter effects.
