Needs bin shift correction

Needs bin options added so that it can either read the beams as written by the generator OR as manually set

Several plots from the paper are only partially implemented.  Needs all of the plots added.


Update: I believe that all of the plots that are not implemented deal with N_{part} so I am not sure how to deal with them. I added beams and binshift.
