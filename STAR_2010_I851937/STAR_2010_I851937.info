Description: Yields, correlation shapes, and mean transverse momenta \pt{} of charged particles associated with intermediate to high-\pt{} trigger particles ($2.5 < \pt < 10$ \GeVc) in d+Au and Au+Au collisions at $\snn=200$ GeV are presented. 
For associated particles at higher $\pt \gtrsim 2.5$ \GeVc, narrow correlation peaks are seen in d+Au and Au+Au, indicating that the main production mechanism is jet fragmentation. 
At lower associated particle $\pt < 2$ \GeVc, a large enhancement of the near- ($\dphi \sim 0$) and away-side ($\dphi \sim \pi$) associated yields is found, together with a strong broadening of the away-side azimuthal distributions in Au+Au collisions compared to d+Au measurements, suggesting that other particle production mechanisms play a role. 
This is further supported by the observed significant softening of the away-side associated particle yield distribution at $\dphi \sim \pi$ in central Au+Au collisions.
