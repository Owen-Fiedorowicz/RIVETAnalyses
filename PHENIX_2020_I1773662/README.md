J/psi and psi(2S) production in pp
Written by Stacyann Nelson, small contributions from Nik Nelson, Sean Grace, Joesph Beller.  In decent shape but needs some tweaks.

Sum of weights needs to be turned off in the readout

Needs beams set up to read them from the HEPMC in Init
Needs to check beams in analyze

This has centrality read in, but it's pp so there is no centrality.
Fig6_Sigma is not normalized

update: 
fixed: - Info file 
       - Plot labels are correct
