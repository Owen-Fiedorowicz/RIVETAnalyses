Description: The PHENIX experiment at the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider has measured the differential cross section, mean transverse momentum, mean transverse momentum squared of inclusive $J/\psi$, and cross section ratio of $\psi$(2S) to $J\psi$ at forward rapidity in $p$+$p$ collisions at $\sqrt{s}$ = 510  GeV via the dimuon decay channel. Comparison is made to inclusive $J/\psi$ cross sections measured at $\sqrt{s}$ = 200 GeV and 2.76–13 TeV. The result is also compared to leading-order nonrelativistic QCD calculations coupled to a color-glass-condensate description of the low-$x$ gluons in the proton at low transverse momentum ($p_T$) and to next-to-leading order nonrelativistic QCD calculations for the rest of the $p_T$ range. These calculations overestimate the data at low $p_T$. While consistent with the data within uncertainties above ≈3 (GeV/$c$), the calculations are systematically below the data. The total cross section times the branching ratio is BR ${d{\sigma_{pp}}{J/\psi}}/{dy}$(1.2 < $|y|$ < 2.2,0 < $p_T$ < 10 (GeV/$c$)) = 54.3 $\pm$ 0.5(stat) $\pm$ 5.5(syst) nb.
