Description:
  '<We report the transverse energy (ET) measured with ALICE at midrapidity in Pb-Pb collisions at  $\sqrt{s_\rm{NN}} = 2.76$ TeV as a function of centrality. The transverse energy was measured using identified single-particle tracks. The measurement was cross checked using the electromagnetic calorimeters and the transverse momentum distributions of identified particles previously reported by ALICE. The results are compared to theoretical models as well as to results from other experiments.>'
