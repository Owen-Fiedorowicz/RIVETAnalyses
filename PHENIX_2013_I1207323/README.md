Gamma-hadron correlations in Au+Au collisions.

This one will be hard for undergraduates to debug.  It still has a lot of work which could be done by an undergraduate.

Needs to be set up so that beams can read in either HEPMC or flag set on command line.

Sum of weights should be turned off in the output.

Look at higher statistics.

Note for discussion:
This uses charged final state.  I think this is right because I think there's no attempt to feeddown correct for lambdas, but I just wanted to flag this for discussion.
