This analysis needs clean up.

The histogram called 'cross_section' has no entries and I suspect that it is actually a counter and not filled.

The numerators and denominators for nuclear modification factors need to have their output suppressed (or they need to have the correct labels added).

update: 
- Nuclear modification factors plotted on a linear scale.
- The bin shift correction applied.
