This analysis needs clean up.

The histogram called 'cross_section' has no entries and I suspect that it is actually a counter and not filled.

The bin shift correction needs to be applied.

The numerators and denominators for nuclear modification factors need to have their output suppressed (or they need to have the correct labels added).

Nuclear modification factors need to be plotted on a linear scale.
