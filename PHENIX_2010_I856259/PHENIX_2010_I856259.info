Description: New measurements by the PHENIX experiment at RHIC for $\eta$ production at midrapidity as a function of transverse momentum ($p_T$) and collision centrality in $\sqrt{s_{NN}}$ = 200 GeV Au+Au and $p$+$p$ collisions are presented. They indicate nuclear modification factors ($R_AA$) that are similar both in magnitude and trend to those found in earlier $\pi^0$ measurements. Linear fits to $R_{AA}$ in the 5-20 (GeV/$c$) $p_T$ region show that the slope is consistent with zero within two standard deviations at all centralities although a slow rise cannot be excluded. Having different statistical and systematic uncertainties the $\pi^0$ and $\eta$ measurements are complementary at high $p_T$ thus, along with the extended $p_T$ range of these data they can provide additional constraints for theoretical modeling and the extraction of transport properties.
