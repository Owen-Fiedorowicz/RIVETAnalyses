Description: The ALICE Collaboration at the CERN Large Hadron Collider reports the first measurement of the inclusive differential jet cross section at mid-rapidity in pp collisions at s=2.76 TeV, with integrated luminosity of 13.6 nb^-^1. 
Jets are measured over the transverse momentum range 20 to 125 GeV/c and are corrected to the particle level. 
Calculations based on Next-to-Leading Order perturbative QCD are in good agreement with the measurements. 
The ratio of inclusive jet cross sections for jet radii R=0.2 and R=0.4 is reported, and is also well reproduced by a Next-to-Leading Order perturbative QCD calculation when hadronization effects are included.
