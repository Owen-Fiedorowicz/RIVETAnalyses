Description: We present measurements of the near side of triggered di-hadron correlations using neutral strange baryons (Λ,Λ¯) and mesons (KS0) at intermediate transverse momentum (3 < pT <6 GeV/c) to look for possible flavor and baryon-meson dependence. 
This study is performed in d+Au, Cu+Cu, and Au+Au collisions at sNN=200 GeV measured by the STAR experiment at RHIC. 
The near-side di-hadron correlation contains two structures, a peak which is narrow in azimuth and pseudorapidity consistent with correlations from jet fragmentation, and a correlation in azimuth which is broad in pseudorapidity. 
The particle composition of the jet-like correlation is determined using identified associated particles. 
The dependence of the conditional yield of the jet-like correlation on the trigger particle momentum, associated particle momentum, and centrality for correlations with unidentified trigger particles are presented. 
The neutral strange particle composition in jet-like correlations with unidentified charged particle triggers is not well described by PYTHIA. 
However, the yield of unidentified particles in jet-like correlations with neutral strange particle triggers is described reasonably well by the same model.
