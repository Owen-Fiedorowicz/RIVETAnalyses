comment: "BNL-RHIC.  Correlations of charged hadrons of 1< pT<10 Gev/cwith highpTdirect
  photons and\u03C00mesonsin the range 5< pT<15 Gev/care used to study jet fragmentation
  in the\u03B3+jet and dijet channels,respectively. The magnitude of the partonic
  transverse momentum,kT, is obtained by comparingto a model incorporating a GaussiankTsmearing.
  The sensitivity of the associated charged hadronspectra to the underlying fragmentation
  function is testedand the data are compared to calculationsusing recent global fit
  results. The shape of the direct photon-associated hadron spectrum as well asits
  charge asymmetry are found to be consistent with a sampledominated by quark-gluon
  Comptonscattering. No significant evidence of fragmentation photon correlated production
  is observed withinexperimental uncertainties.  \n"
