Description: We report high statistics measurements of inclusive charged hadron production in Au+Au and p+p collisions at $\sqrt{s_{NN}}$=200 GeV. A large, approximately constant hadron suppression is observed in central Au+Au collisions for $5<p_T<12$ GeV/c. The collision energy dependence of the yields and the centrality and $p_T$ dependence of the suppression provide stringent constraints on theoretical models of suppression. Models incorporating initial-state gluon saturation or partonic energy loss in dense matter are largely consistent with observations. We observe no evidence of $p_T$-dependent suppression, which may be expected from models incorporating jet attentuation in cold nuclear matter or scattering of fragmentation hadrons.
