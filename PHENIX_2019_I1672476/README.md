Counters need to be turned off in output.
bin shift correction added

"vs cent0" and similar needs to be removed in titles.

Please turn off the following plots in the output:
*_norm
Take these out - these are NOT as labeled: 
d03-x01-y01, d04-x01-y01, d04-x01-y02, d06-x01-y01 -  d11-x01-y01

Please double check that there really are (real) charged particle multiplicities in 62.4 and 39 GeV implemented.

Note that the HEPData are here

but the order got scrambled.
