Description: Measurements of the midrapidity transverse-energy distribution, dET/d$\eta$, are presented for p+p, d+Au, and Au+Au collisions at sNN=200 GeV and additionally for Au+Au collisions at sNN=62.4 and 130 GeV. The dET/$\eta$ distributions are first compared with the number of nucleon participants Npart, number of binary collisions Ncoll, and number of constituent-quark participants Nqp calculated from a Glauber model based on the nuclear geometry. For Au+Au, (dET/d$\eta$)/Npart increases with Npart, while (dET/d$\eta$)/Nqp is approximately constant for all three energies. This indicates that the two-component ansatz, dET/d$\eta \propto$ (1−x)Npart/2+xNcoll, which was used to represent ET distributions, is simply a proxy for Nqp, and that the Ncoll term does not represent a hard-scattering component in ET distributions. The dET/d$\eta$ distributions of Au+Au and d+Au are then calculated from the measured p+p ET distribution using two models that both reproduce the Au+Au data. However, while the number-of-constituent-quark-participant model agrees well with the d+Au data, the additive-quark model does not.
