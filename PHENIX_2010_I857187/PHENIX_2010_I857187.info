Description: Correlations of charged hadrons of 1 < $p_T$ < 10 (GeV/$c$) with high $p_T$ direct photons and $\pi^0$ mesons in the range 5 < $p_T$ < 15 (GeV/$c$) are used to study jet fragmentation in the photon+jet and di-jet channels, respectively. The magnitude of the partonic transverse momentum, $k_T$, is obtained by comparing to a model incorporating a Gaussian $k_T$ smearing. The sensitivity of the associated charged hadron spectra to the underlying fragmentation function is tested and the data are compared to calculations using recent global fit results. The shape of the direct photon-associated hadron spectrum as well as its charge asymmetry are found to be consistent with a sample dominated by quark-gluon Compton scattering. No significant evidence of fragmentation photon correlated production is observed within experimental uncertainties.
