This is a high priority analysis because it is fairly straightforward and something we could get approved quicker than others.

There were two versions, one written by Christal Martin and one written by Andi Mankoli.  I think we kept Christal's version.  This was worked on as well by Adam Tilley and Josie Hakanson, with small contributions from Antonio Da Silva and Sean Grace.
