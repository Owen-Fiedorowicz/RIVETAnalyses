Description: 'The transverse momentum ($p_T$) spectra and ratios of identified charged hadrons ($\pi^{\pm}$, $K^{\pm}$, $p$, $\bar{p}$) produced in $\sqrt{s_{NN}} = 200$ GeV Au+Au and d+Au collisions are reported in five different centrality classes for each collision species. The measurements of pions and protons are reported up to $p_T = 6$ GeV/c (5 GeV/c), and the measurements of kaons are reported up to $p_T = 4$ GeV/c (3.5 GeV/c) in Au+Au (d+Au) collisions. In the intermediate $p_T$ region, between 2-5 GeV/c, a significant enhancement of baryon to meson ratios compared to those measured in $p$+$p$ collisions is observed. This enhancement is present in both Au+Au and d+Au collisions, and increases as the collisions become more central. We compare a class of peripheral Au+Au collisions with a class central d+Au collisions which have a comparable number of participating nucleons and binary nucleon-nucleon collisions. The $p_T$ dependent particle ratios for these classes display a remarkable similarity, which is then  discussed.'
