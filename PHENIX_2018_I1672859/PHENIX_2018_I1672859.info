Description:
  'Production  of $\pi^{0}$ and $\eta$ mesons  has  been  measured  at  midrapidity  in  Cu+Au  collisions  at $\sqrt{s_{NN}}=$200 GeV. Measurements were performed in $\pi^{0}(\eta)\rightarrow\gamma\gamma$ decay channel in the 1(2)-20 GeV/c transverse momentum range.  A strong suppression is observed for $\pi^{0}$ and $\eta$ meson production at high transverse momentum in central Cu+Au collisions relative to the p+p results scaled by the number of nucleon-nucleon collisions. In central collisions the suppression is similar to Au+Au with comparable nuclear overlap.  The $\frac{\eta}{\pi^{0}}$ ratio measured as a function of transverse momentum is con-sistent with $m_{T}$-scaling parameterization down to $p_{T}=$ 2 GeV/c, its asymptotic value is constant and  consistent  with  Au+Au  and p+p and  does  not  show  any  significant  dependence  on  collision centrality. Similar  results  were  obtained  in  hadron-hadron,  hadron-nucleus,  and  nucleus-nucleus collisions as well as in $e^{+}e{−}$ collisions in a range of collision energies $\sqrt{s_{NN}}=$ 3–1800 GeV. Thissuggests that the quark-gluon-plasma medium produced in Cu+Cu collisions either does not affect the jet fragmentation into light mesons or it affects the $\pi^{0}$ and $\eta$ the same way.'
