This is 2-particle correlations relative to the reaction plane.

This one is a doozy.  Someone put error handling in Finalize which prevents it from making any output if some of the histograms are not filled.  That is a bad idea because we can't look at anything!  I think this one is not far from done, but it needs some work.
