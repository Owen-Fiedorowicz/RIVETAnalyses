Description: Azimuthal correlations of charged hadrons with direct-photon ( γdir ) and neutral-pion ( π0 ) trigger particles are analyzed in central Au+Au and minimum-bias p+p collisions at sNN=200 GeV in the STAR experiment. The charged-hadron per-trigger yields at mid-rapidity from central Au+Au collisions are compared with p+p collisions to quantify the suppression in Au+Au collisions. The suppression of the away-side associated-particle yields per γdir trigger is independent of the transverse momentum of the trigger particle ( pTtrig ), whereas the suppression is smaller at low transverse momentum of the associated charged hadrons ( pTassoc ). Within uncertainty, similar levels of suppression are observed for γdir and π0 triggers as a function of zT ( ≡pTassoc/pTtrig ). The results are compared with energy-loss-inspired theoretical model predictions. Our studies support previous conclusions that the lost energy reappears predominantly at low transverse momentum, regardless of the trigger energy.
